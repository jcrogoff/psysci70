          <h2>3D DESIGN</h2>
          <p>
            Our assignment this week was to design and 3D print something not
            easily made with subtractive methods. I started off doing some
            research on what 3D printers are used for in professional product
            construction. I thought this would be a good place to look as people
            are unlikely to use 3D printers in professional circumstances if
            they are not sinficantly helpful (as printers are quite expensive).
            I realized that for the most part, the argument was to use 3D
            printers to make parts that would otherwise need lots of asssembly.
            I found images of these lattice structures online -- which are used
            as a way to have strong but less densse material. These are very
            difficult to make by subtractice methods
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/lattice.jpeg"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <p>
            Source:
            https://www.quora.com/What-things-can-be-manufactured-with-a-3D-printer-that-are-impossible-to-make-otherwise
          </p>
          <p>
            So I set out to make one of these structures. However, it became
            clear very quickly that my skills in fusion were greatly limiting my
            ability to build such a complex structure. So then I started
            thinking about what is kind of difficult to assemble precisely. I
            realized things with curves are extreamly difficult. I then started
            to play around in fusion and came up with the follow design which
            has curved edges, a sphere trapped on the inside, and a sloping top.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/fusion3d1.png"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <img
            src="/images/fusion3d2.png"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />

          <img
            src="/images/fusion3d3.png"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <img
            src="/images/fusion3d4.png"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <img
            src="/images/fusion3d5.png"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <p>
            I wish I had taken some more images as I was playing around because
            its difficult to see the sphere insisde the object. If there's one
            thing I learned from this design expirence in fusion it is that next
            time I really need to take the time to make more bodies. Right now
            it is virtually impossible to edit the size of the sphere, or to put
            anything else inside the object, because it is all one component.
            Next time I will separate everything into multiple components that
            way I can edit one thing at a time without having to start the whole
            component from scratch. This division would also have made it easier
            to take screenshots of the different angles of my object.
          </p>
          <h2>SLICING</h2>
          <p>
            Next, I fed my 3D design into the slicer. Because my design was
            quite large and complex, I chose the print setting 0.20mm SPEED MK3.
            Which was one step of priciseness above the draft stage but still
            quite fast MK3. I also set the infill at 10% as Rob said this was
            sufficient and would still print quickly. In the following image you
            can see the progression of the print. In this image you can alos get
            a better idea of what the sphere looks like hidden inside the
            object.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/sliced.gif"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <p>
            And after letting the printer run for three hours -- here is the
            final object.
          </p>

            src="/images/3dob1.jpeg"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <img
            src="/images/3dob2.jpeg"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />

          <img
            src="/images/3dob3.jpeg"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <img
            src="/images/3dob4.jpeg"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <img
            src="/images/3dob5.jpeg"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <h2>SCANNING</h2>
          <p>
            For the scanning portion of the assignment this week I came in and
            used the spider scanner. I found putting down white sheets of paper
            made it easier for me to scan the object.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/scansetup.png"
            class="img-responsive margin"
            style="width:100%"
            alt="Image"
          />
          <p>
            I have a little "thinker" sculpture which I scanned. It turned out
            okay -- I found doing a few long scans was more helpful here than
            doing many short scans. Below is an image of my scan. I haven't been
            able to open the file on my computer since scanning and exporting so
            I'd love some help with that.
          </p>
